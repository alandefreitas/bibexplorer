# Limitations

We have not integrated many APIs yet. [`docs/APIs.md`](APIs.md) includes a list of APIs we are considering with their pros and cons. 

The CSV and JSON input formats have a "Citations" field where one can directly enter the number of citations for each paper. This can be used to mitigate this lack of APIs. 

We currently use the Microsoft Academic API but it seems to be very limited to find data about most papers. We are still studying which APIs could provide us with more useful data.
