# Packages

Get the binary package from the [release section](https://github.com/alandefreitas/bibexplorer/releases). These binaries refer to the last release version of BibExplorer. 

If you need a more recent version, you can download the [binary packages from the CI artifacts](https://github.com/alandefreitas/bibexplorer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+BibExplorer%22+event%3Apush) or build the library [from the source files](build-from-source.md).

For convenience, you might want to add the BibExplorer directory to "`PATH`": 

* [Windows](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html)
* [Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/)
* [Mac OS](https://www.architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/)
